# classactivity12A

This class activity is intended to demonstrate:

- An iterative implementation (as opposed to a recursive implementation) of depth first search using a stack.  For the stack we will use a Python deque.
- An algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles.
- Some examples of Python code whose behaviour requires a little decyphering.

You can use this repository in one of two ways:

- You can clone it directly using the standard Git procedure.  In that case you **will not** be able to push your edits back up to this repository (you only have read access to this repository).
- You can copy this repository as a template in to your own GitHub account by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).  Using your own copy you can then push and pull as much as you like.  (We recommend that you make your own copy private so that other students won't confuse your repository with this one.)
